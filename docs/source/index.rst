What does the role do?
----------------------
This role uses the |benchmark_name| `Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)`_ guidance 
from the `Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)`_. The STIG is released with a 
public domain license and it is commonly used to secure systems at public and private
organizations around the world.

We analyze each configuration hardening item from the applicable STIG benchmark
to determine what impact it has on a live production environment and how to
best implement it using Ansible. Tasks are added to the role that configure a host
to meet the configuration requirements. Each task is documented to explain what was
changed, why it was changed, and what deployers need to understand about the change.

Deployers have the option to enable/disable STIG items that do not suit their environments
needs. Each STIG item has an associated variable that can be used to switch it on or off.
Additionally, the items that have configurable values, i.e. number of password attempts, will
generally have a corresponding variable that allows for customization of the applied value.
It is imperative for each deployer to understand the regulations and compliance requirements
that their organization and specific environments are responsible for meeting in order to
effeectively implement the controls in the |benchmark_name_short| STIG.
